# Simple-Classification-of-skin-cancer-using-CNN
This is a simple classification of malignant and benign skin cancers using CNN.

Skin cancer is a generic term for malignant tumors that occur in the skin, and in 2018, more than 1.3 million new cases worldwide were diagnosed with skin cancer. It is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. Skin cancer is usually visually detected by a dermatologist.

Based on these diagnostic characteristics, in this report, using convolutional neural network(CNN), we will construct a network that distinguishes benign and malignant skin tumors through images and analyze how good the network works.
